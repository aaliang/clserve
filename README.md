# clserver

A vertx project that rocks!

## Usage

$ lein vertx run

or

$ vertx run core.clj

dockerfile included:

build the image:

  docker build -t clserver
  
run it (it will pull dependencies the first time)

  docker run -i -t clserve lein vertx run

recommend using this as a base image since the above command will wipe out the dependencies and vertx does not seem to support installing dependencies automatically outside of the initial run:

  docker commit %IMAGE-ID% my-clserve

run it again fresh:

  docker run -i -t my-clserve lein vertx run
